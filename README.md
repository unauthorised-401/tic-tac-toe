# tic-tac-toe
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Python. The game features a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter and includes an AI opponent powered by the Minimax algorithm.

## Features

- Play against an AI opponent that uses the Minimax algorithm for optimal moves.
- Simple and intuitive graphical user interface using Tkinter.
- Interactive gameplay with real-time updates.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/unauthorised-401/tic-tac-toe.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd tic-tac-toe
3. Install the required dependencies (if any). For Tkinter, it comes pre-installed with Python, but you can ensure it's installed using:
    ```bash
    pip install tk

## How to Play

Run the game.py file to start the game:

    python game.py
    
The game window will open.

Click on the cells of the Tic Tac Toe board to make your move. The AI will automatically make its move after you.

The game will declare the winner once a player gets three in a row, or declare a draw if the board is full without any winner.
